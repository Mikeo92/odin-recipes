    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>An apple pie is a pie in which the principal filling ingredient is apples. The earliest printed recipe is from England. Apple pie is often served with whipped cream, ice cream, or cheddar cheese. It is generally double-crusted, with pastry both above and below the filling; the upper crust may be solid or latticed (woven of crosswise strips). The bottom crust may be baked separately to prevent it from getting soggy. Deep-dish apple pie often has a top crust only. Tarte Tatin is baked with the crust on top, but served with it on the bottom.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul> 

        <li>1/3 cup sugar</li>
        <li>1/3 cup packed brown sugar</li>    
        <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>6 to 7 cups thinly sliced peeled tart apples</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>1 large egg white</li>       

    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>

        <li>Preheat oven to 375Â°. On a lightly floured surface, roll one half of dough to a 1/8-in.-thick circle; transfer to a 9-in. pie plate. In a small bowl, combine sugars, flour and spices; set aside. In a large bowl, toss apples with lemon juice. Add sugar mixture; toss to coat. Add filling; dot with butter. </li>
        <li>Roll remaining dough to a 1/8-in.-thick circle. Place over filling. Trim, seal and flute edge. Cut slits in top. Beat egg white until foamy; brush over crust. If desired, sprinkle with turbinado sugar and ground cinnamon. Cover edge loosely with foil.</li>
        <li> Bake 25 minutes. Remove foil; bake until crust is golden brown and filling is bubbly, 20-25 minutes longer. Cool on a wire rack. If desired, serve with ice cream and caramel sauce.</li>
